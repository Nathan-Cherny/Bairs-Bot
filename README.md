# Bairs-Bot
Calculates upsets from each bairs and posts it on a twitter account

also does some other stuff using the data from bairs

this is a personal project i made to challenge myself to work with unfamiliar APIs (twitter api, tweepy, start.gg api) and to do something cool for the philly smash scene

main function is makeThread() which gets the upset info from the previous bairs and makes a twitter thread
has two graphs it can make, one that graphs attendees across all bairs and another that tallys each winner of every bairs
